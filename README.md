# SechandGinAngular

Sechand-Gin-Angular is a platform for student to post their second-hand trade information. I use [Angular](https://angular.io) to build its frontend and use [gin](https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin) - a web framework in Go to build a RESTful backend.

## Notice

* This repository only contain the frontend part of the project, and the backend part is [here](https://github.com/Xwai/sechand-gin-api).

* This project is a course project of Fudan University in 2017 Spring semester.

* Run `npm install` before you run `ng serve`.
